prototype farm sim, alpha 0.03. working title "Fairy Farm"
 
compiled with GCC 11.2, using SFML 2.5.1 and the C amalgamation of SQLite 3.39.4.

set on a procedurally generated island, this farm sim is designed with no time pressure. the season only advances when the player sleeps, leaving them free to pursue whatever they want for as long as they want.

current features:
- farming!
- raw material gathering, i.e. trees and rocks
- inventory management and storage
- machines for processing materials into valuable and useful products
- crafting recipes, for making a variety of objects
- vehicles, namely a boat and a flying broom

planned features:
- perennial plants, which come back year after year, increasing yields as they mature
- dynamic weather
- magic, primarily for weather manipulation
- fishing
- dialogue
- trading (currently, seeds are only obtained via the seed sifter machine)

this project is currently dormant pending engine upgrades
